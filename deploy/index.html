            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <p>Hermit Crabs are wonderful pets that are easy to look after. The hermit crab has evolved to be able to live on land with the use of empty shells as a home and protection. </p>

            <h3>ONE</h3>
            <p>Land hermit crabs need to be fed daily and in little amounts at a time to ensure the food is fresh. Land hermit crabs are omnivorous scavengers and can feed on commercial diet, vegetables, microalgae, animal poop, baby food, fruits, leaf litter, and decaying wood. They also enjoy breads, cereals, apples and other fruits, and shredded coconut.
                <br>Make sure any food that isnâ€™t eaten that day is removed. Other wise if your hermit crab is too full they will feel clawful! </p>

            <h2>SHELL</h2>
            <h3>TWO</h3>
            <p>If you choose to painting your little buddy's shell there are a few things you'll need to consider first. An acrylic-based non-toxic paint is best for shells, however it is the non-toxic glaze that actually makes it shell-safe. Glazing gives it the nice smooth, glossy finish and seals in the paint and prohibits the crabs from being exposed to any potentially harmful paint chipping. 
                <br>Or you can live on the edge and let your hermit crab paint its own shell... it will be a master piece!</p>

            <h3>THREE</h3>
            <p>Hermit crabs are social creatures that like to live in large groups, so they can get lonely if left alone too long. One option to prevent loneliness is to get multiple crabs. If you do add one or more hermit crabs to an existing tank, keep an eye out for fighting. Some hermit crabs are aggressive with others and may try to steal shells. Having spare shells in the aquarium can help prevent fighting.
