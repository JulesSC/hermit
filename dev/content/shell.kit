        <h2>SHELL</h2>
        <h3>TWO</h3>
        <p>If you choose to painting your little buddy's shell there are a few things you'll need to consider first. An acrylic-based non-toxic paint is best for shells, however it is the non-toxic glaze that actually makes it shell-safe. Glazing gives it the nice smooth, glossy finish and seals in the paint and prohibits the crabs from being exposed to any potentially harmful paint chipping. 
            <br>Or you can live on the edge and let your hermit crab paint its own shell... it will be a master piece!</p>
