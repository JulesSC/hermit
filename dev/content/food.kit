        <h3>ONE</h3>
        <p>Land hermit crabs need to be fed daily and in little amounts at a time to ensure the food is fresh. Land hermit crabs are omnivorous scavengers and can feed on commercial diet, vegetables, microalgae, animal poop, baby food, fruits, leaf litter, and decaying wood. They also enjoy breads, cereals, apples and other fruits, and shredded coconut.
            <br>Make sure any food that isnâ€™t eaten that day is removed. Other wise if your hermit crab is too full they will feel clawful! </p>
