        <p>Hermit crabs are social creatures that like to live in large groups, so they can get lonely if left alone too long. One option to prevent loneliness is to get multiple crabs. If you do add one or more hermit crabs to an existing tank, keep an eye out for fighting. Some hermit crabs are aggressive with others and may try to steal shells. Having spare shells in the aquarium can help prevent fighting.
            <br>Who doesnt like boxing hermit crabs?
